## Branch Information
This branch is the start of the project.  My goal is to create my first window in C++. 
If I get that working, this branch will close and be merged into master.
New branches will be created for each feature that I work on.
Hopefully I will be able to maintain a modularity in my programming that will result in this not causing problems.

## Introduciton
This program is a personal reconstruction of a previous project that I led.  
The purpose of this reconstruction is practice, so that I can get back into working on that version cleanly and know what I am doing again.

This is the link to a fork of the original set:

## Description
This program is meant to help people create and manage characters in Pathfinder the tabletop RPG.
Future developments will include being able to make homebrew modules that you can share with your friends that will auto-load their module into the existing rules.
I intend to make profiles for different module sets, so that someone can have a different module profile for each character.
This is so that you don't have the one homebrew feat from your cousin's campaign showing up in your internet based Sunday campaign.

I would love this project to become the size of other similar programs like D&D Beyond or charactersheet.co.uk (Personal favorite online character sheet (Support them)), but with a focus on being offline for cheaper upkeep, and more open sharing of modules.

I may end up making a website for the sharing of modules, but that would be after the majority of the module creation, separation, exporting, and importing is all done, as well as the rest of the basic functions.

## Thanks
Thanks also to Paizo, who made the Pathfinder RPG, and aren't locking it out from projects like this.
