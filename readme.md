## Introduciton
This program is a personal reconstruction of a previous project that I led.  
The purpose of this reconstruction is practice, so that I can get back into working on that version cleanly and know what I am doing again.

This is the link to the original set:

## Description
This program is meant to help people create and manage characters in Pathfinder the tabletop RPG.
Future developments will include being able to make homebrew modules that you can share with your friends that will auto-load their module into the existing rules.
I intend to make profiles for different module sets, so that someone can have a different module profile for each character.
This is so that you don't have the one homebrew feat from your cousin's campaign showing up in your internet based Sunday campaign.

I would love this project to become the size of other similar programs like D&D Beyond or charactersheet.co.uk (Personal favorite online character sheet (Support them)), but with a focus on being offline for cheaper upkeep, and more open sharing of modules.

I may end up making a website for the sharing of modules, but that would be after the majority of the module creation, separation, exporting, and importing is all done, as well as the rest of the basic functions.

## Thanks
Thanks to dhagerty9009 and dchesser for their help with the version we made during school, please check them out if you wish.
They are both great coders that put good work into the project and I have learned from both of them.

Also thanks to Paizo for making the game and making so much of the game open to be shared, which allows a program such as this to exist.
They do NOT sponser or have any stake in this program however, as it is a purely personal project, the link to the full disclaimer and all that legal stuff will be in here soon.
